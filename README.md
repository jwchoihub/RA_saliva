# Seronegative RA Oral Microbiota Analysis

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the analysis codes used in our study on the oral microbiota of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

### Overview

This repository contains the scripts and resources necessary for analyzing and visualizing oral microbiota data obtained from a cohort study. Our research aims to identify distinct features of the oral microbiota associated with seronegative RA by analyzing saliva samples.

### Data and Methods

- **Sample Collection**: Saliva samples were collected from participants to extract and sequence 16S rRNA.
- **Data Processing**: Pre-processing of the sequencing data was carried out using Qiime2 and DADA2, ensuring high-quality sequence data for downstream analysis.
- **Analysis**: This repository focuses on the subsequent analysis and visualization of the pre-processed sequence data using R.
